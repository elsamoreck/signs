            <h2>üö® Let Me Save You a Shit Ton of Heartbreak Right Now</h2>
            <p>If you see any of these red flags, RUN. Don't walk, don't make excuses, don't try to fix her. These behaviors reveal character flaws that will destroy your relationship and your peace of mind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-banner">
            <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warning</h3>
            <p>These aren't minor personality quirks‚Äîthey're massive red flags that predict relationship disaster. Pay attention in the first few dates because people show you who they really are early. Believe them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="red-flag-section">
            <div class="flag-number">üö©</div>
            <h3 class="flag-title">She Flirts With Other Men in Front of You</h3>
            
            <div class="flag-description">
                If she's comfortable flirting with other men in front of you, what is she comfortable doing when you're not around? This behavior shows a complete lack of respect for you and your relationship.
            </div>

            <div class="the-behavior">
                <h4>üé≠ What This Looks Like</h4>
                <p>Excessive touching, laughing at every guy's jokes, giving other men her full attention while ignoring you, making suggestive comments, or "playfully" flirting and calling it harmless.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="deeper-concern">
                <h4>üéØ The Deeper Issue</h4>
                <p>This isn't about insecurity‚Äîit's about respect. A woman who truly values you won't seek attention from other men, especially not right in front of you. This behavior reveals her priorities and boundaries (or lack thereof).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="examples">
                <h4>üö´ Red Flag Examples</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Touching the waiter's arm while ordering</li>
                    <li>Giving her number to guys "for work" at social events</li>
                    <li>Constantly checking and responding to texts from other men during your date</li>
                    <li>Making comments about how "hot" other guys are</li>
                    <li>Dancing intimately with other men at parties</li>

            </div>

            <div class="action-advice">
                <h4>‚úÖ What to Do</h4>
                <p>Address it once, clearly and calmly. If she gets defensive or continues the behavior, you have your answer. A woman who respects you will immediately adjust her behavior and apologize.</p>

            <div class="flag-description">
                When she says things like "I don't usually do this, but..." it sounds like she's easily able to bend her boundaries. If she's bending them for you now, what other boundaries will she bend later?
            </div>

            <div class="the-behavior">
                <h4>üé≠ What This Sounds Like</h4>
                <p>"I don't usually sleep with guys on the first date, but..." or "I don't usually let men pay for everything, but..." It's supposed to be flattering, but it reveals inconsistent standards.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="deeper-concern">
                <h4>üéØ The Deeper Issue</h4>
                <p>Boundaries aren't suggestions‚Äîthey're standards. If she can easily bend her "rules" for you, she can bend them for other people too. Consistent values and boundaries are crucial for long-term relationships.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="what-it-means">
                <h4>üß† What This Really Means</h4>
                <p>She either: 1) Never had real boundaries to begin with, 2) Makes exception-based decisions rather than principle-based ones, or 3) Is telling you what she thinks you want to hear. None of these are good.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="action-advice">
                <h4>‚úÖ What to Look For Instead</h4>
                <p>Look for women who have clear standards and stick to them consistently. She should have boundaries that she maintains regardless of the situation or person.</p>

                I don't know about you, but I am past the point where I want to babysit a grown adult. If she's gulping drinks on the first few dates when she's still making a first impression, imagine how it's going to be later.

                <p>Ordering multiple drinks quickly, getting noticeably drunk on early dates, not knowing her limits, becoming sloppy or overly emotional when drinking, or using alcohol as a crutch for social situations.</p>

                <p>It's not about alcohol itself‚Äîit's about self-control, judgment, and responsibility. If she can't manage herself around alcohol during the "best behavior" phase of dating, this is a preview of future problems.</p>

                <h4>üí≠ Reality Check</h4>
                <p>You want a partner, not a project. A grown woman should be able to handle herself in social situations without you having to monitor her intake or clean up her messes.</p>

                <h4>‚úÖ What to Do</h4>
                <p>Pay attention to her relationship with alcohol early. Does she need to drink to have fun? Can she stop at one or two? Does drinking change her personality dramatically? These are important indicators.</p>

                How someone treats people who "can't do anything for them" reveals their true character. If she's rude to waiters, baristas, or retail workers, she's showing you who she really is when the mask comes off.
